<h3>The Framework</h3>
</aside>

<article>
<p>Neat is an open source fluid grid framework on top of http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon. The grid and typography are built using ems and percentages based off of the golden ratio so that it can remain easily scalable and produces visually appealing results. Neat uses all mixins for its grid to encourage semantic and meaningful classes.</p>
<h3>Why is Neat not fully responsive?</h3>
<p>We believe that a fully responsive framework would depend on Sass 3.2</p>
